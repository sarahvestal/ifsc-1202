#There was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost.
#Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.
#Hint: This solution has three parts. Suppose you have 10 cards.
#First, sum the values from 1 to 10. This the total value of the cards.
#Next, read each card (there will be 9 of them) and sum of their values.
#Finally, subract the two sums. The difference is the missing card.
#Enter Number of Cards: 5
#Enter Card: 1
#Enter Card: 2
#Enter Card: 4
#Enter Card: 5
#Missing Card: 3
