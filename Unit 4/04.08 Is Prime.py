#A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
#Given an integer N > 1, print PRIME if it's prime and print COMPOSITE otherwise.
#Hint: Loop from 2 to (half of N) + 1 and check to see if any number evenly divides into N.
#Enter N: 4
#COMPOSITE
#Enter N: 5
#PRIME
