#Create a python program that performs unit conversions. You code should do the following:

#Prompt for a floating point number (FromValue). Your prompt should display "Enter From Value: "
#Prompt for the unit to convert from (FromUnit). Your prompt should display "Enter From Unit (in, ft, yd, mi):"
#Using an if statement make sure that the from unit is one of the following: in, ft, yd, mi. If not, display "FromUnit is not valid" and then exit the program
#Prompt for the unit to convert to (ToUnit). Your prompt should display "Enter From Unit (in, ft, yd, mi):"
#Using an if statement make sure that the to unit is one of the following: in, ft, yd, mi. If not, display "ToUnit is not valid" and then exit the program
#Using a series of if statements, determine the value of multiplier needed to convert the value using the FromUnit to the ToUnit. You will need 16 of them. If a user enters the same FromUnit and ToUnit, then the multiplier is 1.0 (See http://www.unit-conversion.info/length.html)
#if FromUnit == "ft" and ToUnit == "yd": multiplier = 0.3333333333

#Finally, multiply the multiplier times the FromValue to get the ToValue (Use the round function to round to 7 digits)
#Display the FromValue, FromUnit, ToValue and ToUnit as shown
#Here are some test cases. You answer may be slightly different due to rounding.

#Enter From Value: 36
#Enter From Unit (in, ft, yd, mi): in
#Enter To Unit (in, ft, yd, mi): yd
#36.0 in => 1.0 yd
